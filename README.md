<h2>What is state in React Js</h2>
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.

<h2>Why do we need redux ?</h2>
Redux allows you to manage your app’s state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable.

<h2>What Pain does redux solves</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Redux is a global state</li>
  <li>Redux is not necessary for every project.</li>
  <li>You may need Redux if you don’t want to do props drilling (passing props too deep).</li>
  <li>If you are still confused about Redux, just think about the React state. The only difference is you can access the state from anywhere.</li>
</ul>
